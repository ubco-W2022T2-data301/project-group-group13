# Project Vision

## Vision Statement 

For our project we invision that we will be able to make a connection between the growing autonomous vehicle market and whether it is a safety hazard or not. In order for us to fulfill this invision we will be looking at our data set to find the connection between the the growing market of autonomous vehicles being sold and whether this leads to an increase to safety on the roads or a decrease. One of the main arguments for autonomous vehicles is that it will eliminate human error but our data set will help us get a small sample of whether machines can fix this human error or make it worse.

## Contracted Grade

For this project, we agree to contract for a B grade with hopes that we can improve on our grade later.
