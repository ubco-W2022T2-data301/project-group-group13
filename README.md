## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Autonomous vehicles are increasing on the road, and will inevitably have an impact on road safety. With Tesla being one of the biggest manufacturers of autonomous vehicles, their vehicles make up the majority of the autonomous vehicles seen on the road today. It is vital to demonstrate whether Tesla vehicles are complicating or solving the issue of road safety, given their growing numbers. One of the interesting questions that the project aims to tackle is whether Tesla's autonomous vehicles are living up to Elon Musk's claims. In the past, he had made many claims that Tesla's autonomous vehicles will be the solution to car accidents by eliminating human error. It would be interesting to see whether the results here will support or refute his claims. This should be an interesting dataset for everyone because we all transition between driver, pedestrian, and passenger roles throughout our day of commute, and should be concerned whether autonomous vehicles at their current stage are as incredible as their manufacturer claims.

The dataset used here contains data on automobile incidents involving Tesla vehicles. A variety of info is included in dataset: time, location, and description of the incident, as well as the number of deaths and usage of autopilot during the incident. Data collection began in 2013 and the dataset has been updated annually, including recent incidents in 2023. The aim of the dataset is for investigation of Tesla’s autopilot vehicles and their impact on road safety, and to educate policymakers and stakeholders with relevant results. As well, the data here can be used as evidence to confirm or refute some of Elon Musk’s claims regarding Tesla vehicles’ safety. Data is collected through news articles and reports, with confirmed information from parties involved in the incident as well.
