# Group 13 - {Autonomous Tesla Accidents vs USA User Operated Crashes}

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our topic of interest is the tesla motor company and more specifically their autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are increasing on the road and will inevitably have an impact on road safety. With Tesla being one of the biggest manufacturers of autonomous vehicles, their vehicles make up the majority of the autonomous vehicles seen on the road today. It is vital to demonstrate whether Tesla vehicles are complicating or solving the issue of road safety, given their growing numbers. One of the interesting questions that the project aims to tackle is whether Tesla's autonomous vehicles are better than regular human operated vehicles. This will be achievable by comparing the crash and fatality results between the autonomous vehicle deaths from tesla and regular human operated casualties over the years in the United States. This will help to give us a broader spectrum of what is causing the vehicle deaths or if they are just inevitable with the vehicles on the road. The idea that safety may no longer be a concern with autonomously operated vehicles is very interesting as it may put people out of jobs as well as change the way everyday life operates.

## Describe your data set in about 150-200 words

The dataset used here contains data on automobile incidents involving Tesla vehicles. A variety of info is included in dataset: time, location, and description of the incident, as well as the number of deaths and usage of autopilot during the incident. Data collection began in 2013 and the dataset has been updated annually, including recent incidents in 2023. The aim of the dataset is for investigation of Teslaâ€™s autopilot vehicles and their impact on road safety, and to educate policymakers and stakeholders with relevant results. We also have a supplementary data set bringing regular human operated vehicle deaths in the United States in 2011. This will help us get an idea of the average human error as well as the comparison to that of the automated vehicle crashes and how they are the same or differ in crash mechanism and numbers. Both of our data sets include how the crash happened, the number of fatalities as well as when and where in the world the accidents had taken place.
