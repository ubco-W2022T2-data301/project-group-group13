# Final Report - Group 13

## Introduction
Our group was interested in exploring whether or not the tesla self-driving vehicles are responsible for the crashes that they are involved in or if it is more due to human error. Our group is made up of car fanatics and we are very interested in the different types of vehicle safety mechanisms and if the new concept of "self-driving' vechicles is really the future of automobiles. This project is very important to the world because it helps to identify the positive and negative effects of the autonomous Tesla vehicles and if they will be good for the future generations or if they are viable now.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Through our EDA we made a few different observations:
- Weather was not a major factor in causing most crashes
- Most Autonomous crashes were self caused with no other vehicles involved
- Age and day have an impact on number of crashes


## Question 1: Do autonomous and human operated vehicles have the same machanism of fatality?

To answer the question in its entirety the autonomous vehicles are to blame for most of the Tesla fatalities. The human interferance with the autonomous vehicles is not nearly as high as human operated cars which shows that the mechanism for fatality is not the same for both types of vehicles.

## Question 2: How do the rates of crashes involving autonomous vehicles compare to crashes caused by human drivers, and is one safer than the other?
One option does not seem safer than the other, they just pose different kinds of dangers. Autonomous vehicles still need a lot of work

## Summary
- Autonomic driving is still not where it needs to be to become mainstream
- There is an inherent risk to any mode of transportation
- There are many external factors that affect safety while driving that are unavoidable


## Conclusion
In conclusion with both of our research queestions being answered to the best of the datasets ability we are able to conquer that the autonomous vehicles are both a high mechanism of fatality when it comes to car crashes involving autonomous vehicles, as well we still have a way to go before we can begin relying fully on self-driving vehicles. All of our data points to the fact that the autonomous vehicles can be unpredictable and that they shoulder most of the tesla car accident problems, although human operated vehicles are not perfect as well our data also explains all of the different factors that can affect human operated vehicles and why the crashes occur outside of human error.
