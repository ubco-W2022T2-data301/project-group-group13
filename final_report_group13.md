# Final Report - Group 13

## Introduction
Our group was interested in exploring whether or not the tesla self-driving vehicles are responsible for the crashes that they are involved in or if it is more due to human error. Our group is made up of car fanatics and we are very interested in the different types of vehicle safety mechanisms and if the new concept of "self-driving' vechicles is really the future of automobiles. This project is very important to the world because it helps to identify the positive and negative effects of the autonomous Tesla vehicles and if they will be good for the future generations or if they are viable now.
