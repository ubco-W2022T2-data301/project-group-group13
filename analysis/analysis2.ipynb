    "I Am interested in the how car crashes compare between an autonomous vehicle and one that is driven by a person. Where and when they occur and differences in how they occur. I think that understanding the how autonomous driving can go wrong compared to when a person is driving sets a good benchmark to determine how far along we are in the process and how far away we are from fully self driving cars.\n"
