    "For my research question I want to focus on whether the autonomous vehicle crash mechanism is different from the United States human operated vehicle crashes. I think in order to do this I will compile data that is specific to how the crashes happened and what vehicles are involved. I will also look at where the crashes happened on the road to see if this leads to any patterns in the human driving vs what the tesla vehicles are crashing into."
